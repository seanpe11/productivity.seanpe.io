# Productivity - Sean Pe

I figured that a simple productivity app would be a good way to practice my skills and learn more about the technologies I'm interested in. It'll help me gamify my productivity in addition to being a solid place for me to keep track of progress and provide a way to encode habits into a form that I can review.

## Tech Stack
Basically the t3 stack, just adding PWA support so I can also use it offline and on my phone.

# TODO:
